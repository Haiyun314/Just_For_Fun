# Just_For_Fun
Here’s a collection of fun projects—some might be failed experiments, while some result in interesting creations.

## Rcnn_Pinns
(Failed Experiment)
This project originally used an RCNN architecture to simulate the 2D heat equation, but the results were "sehr schlechte". The architecture was then rebuilt using a CNN structure, but the outcomes are still disappointing. I might revisit and reconstruct it when a new idea strikes.
